# The Red Book
The Bar Standards Board *Handbook*, but comprehensible!  

For all barristers and students on the Bar Course, the *Handbook* is an indispensible document.  Unfortunately, its official formatting is so terrible as to render its ethical teachings difficult to understand.  I believe one goal of policy should be to make doing good things easier, and therefore it should be easy to read the *Handbook* and follow its ethical pronouncements.

The actual *Red Book* can be downloaded by clicking here.  I have made no editorial decisions whatsoever, so all typographical errors and other strange faults (like using the wrong spelling of 'to practise' at one point, or listing the same provision twice in a row at another) are part of the text handed down from on high.

That is all for most people, but for those who are curious, the next section details the technical points behind the *Red Book*, in case it is of use.
