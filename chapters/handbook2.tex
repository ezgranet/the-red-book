The Core Duties are not presented in order of precedence, subject to the
following:
\begin{numlist}\item \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD1}} overrides any other core duty, if and to the extent the two are
inconsistent. Rules rC3(5) and rC4 deal specifically with the
relationship between \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD1}}, \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD2}} and  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD4}}~and you should refer to those
rules and to the related Guidance;
\item in certain other circumstances set out in this Code of Conduct one
Core Duty overrides another. Specifically, Rule rC16 provides that \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD2}}
(as well as being subject to \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD1}}) is subject to your obligations under
 \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD3}},  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD4}} and  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD8}}.
\end{numlist}

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC2}

Your obligation to take reasonable steps to manage your \emph{practice},
or carry out your role within your \emph{practice}, competently and in
such a way as to achieve compliance with your legal and regulatory
obligations (CD10) includes an obligation to take all reasonable steps
to mitigate the effects of any breach of those legal and regulatory
obligations once you become aware of the same.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC2A}

Your obligation to be open and co-operative with your regulators ( \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD9}})
includes being open and co-operative with all relevant regulators and
ombudsman schemes, including but not limited to approved regulators
under the Legal Services Act 2007 and the Legal Ombudsman.

C3-C6 }


\rulesubsection{rc3}

You owe a duty to the \emph{court} to act with independence in the
interests of justice. This duty overrides any inconsistent obligations
which you may have (other than obligations under the criminal law). It
includes the following specific obligations which apply whether you are
acting as an advocate or are otherwise involved in the conduct of
litigation in whatever role (with the exception of Rule C3(1) below,
which applies when acting as an advocate):

\begin{numlist}\item You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must not}} knowingly or recklessly mislead or attempt to mislead
the \emph{court};
\item You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must not}} abuse your role as an advocate;
\item You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} take reasonable steps to avoid wasting the \emph{court's}
time;
\item You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} take reasonable steps to ensure that the \emph{court} has
before it all relevant decisions and legislative provisions;
\item You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} ensure that your ability to act independently is not
compromised.
\end{numlist}

\rulesubsection{rc4}

Your duty to act in the best interests of each \emph{client} is subject
to your duty to the \emph{court}.

\rulesubsection{rc5}

Your duty to the \emph{court} \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{does not}} require you to act in breach of
your duty to keep the affairs of each \emph{client} confidential.

\subsection{Not misleading the court}

\rulesubsection{rc6}

Your duty not to mislead the \emph{court} will include the following
obligations:
\begin{numlist}\item You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must not}}:
\begin{alphlist}\item make submissions, representations or any other statement; or
\item ask questions which suggest facts to witnesses
which you know, or are instructed, are untrue or misleading.\end{alphlist}
\item You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must not}} call witnesses to give evidence or put affidavits or
witness statements to the \emph{court} which you know, or are
\emph{instructed}, are untrue or misleading, unless you make clear to
the \emph{court} the true position as known by or instructed to you.
\end{numlist}

\guidancesection{Guidance
to Rules C3-C6 and relationship to \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD1}}-CD2 }


\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC3}

Rules rC3 -- rC6 set out some specific aspects of your duty to the
\emph{court} (\textcolor{mygold}{\textbf{CD1}}). See \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD1}} and associated Guidance at gC1.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC4}

As to your duty not to mislead the court:
\begin{numlist}\item knowingly misleading the \emph{court} includes being complicit in
another person misleading the court;
\item knowingly misleading the \emph{court} also includes inadvertently
misleading the court if you later realise that you have misled the
\emph{court}, and you fail to correct the position;
\item recklessly means being indifferent to the truth, or not caring
whether something is true or false; and
\item the duty continues to apply for the duration of the case.
\end{numlist}
\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC5}

Your duty under Rule rC3(4)~includes drawing to the attention of the
\emph{court} any decision or provision which may be adverse to the
interests of your \emph{client}. It is particularly important where you
are appearing against a litigant who is not legally represented.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC6}

You are obliged by \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD2}} to promote and to protect your \emph{client's}
interests so far as that is consistent with the law and with your
overriding duty to the \emph{court} under \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD1}}. Your duty to the
\emph{court} \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{does not}} prevent you from putting forward your
\emph{client's} case simply because you do not believe that the facts
are as your \emph{client} states them to be (or as you, on your
\emph{client's} behalf, state them to be), as long as any positive case
you put forward accords with your \emph{instructions} and you do not
mislead the \emph{court}. Your role when acting as an advocate or
conducting litigation is to present your \emph{client's} case, and it is
not for you to decide whether your \emph{client's} case is to be
believed.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC7}

For example, you are entitled and it may often be appropriate to draw to
the witness's attention other evidence which appears to conflict with
what the witness is saying and you are entitled to indicate that a
\emph{court} may find a particular piece of evidence difficult to
accept. But if the witness maintains that the evidence is true, it
should be recorded in the witness statement and you will not be
misleading the \emph{court} if you call the witness to confirm their
witness statement. Equally, there may be circumstances where you call a
hostile witness whose evidence you are instructed is untrue. You will
not be in breach of Rule rC6 if you make the position clear to the
\emph{court}. See, further, the guidance at gC14.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC8}

As set out in Rule rC5, your duty to the \emph{court} \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{does not}} permit or
require you to disclose confidential information which you have obtained
in the course of your \emph{instructions} and which your client has not
authorised you to disclose to the \emph{court}. However, Rule rC6
requires you not knowingly to mislead the \emph{court}. There may be
situations where you have obligations under both these rules.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC9}

Rule rC4 makes it clear that your duty to act in the best interests of
your \emph{client} is subject to your duty to the \emph{court}. For
example, if your \emph{client} were to tell you that they have committed
the crime with which they were charged, in order to be able to ensure
compliance with Rule rC4 on the one hand and Rule rC3 and Rule rC6 on
the other:
\begin{numlist}\item you would not be entitled to disclose that information to the
\emph{court} without your \emph{client's} consent; and
\item you would not be misleading the \emph{court} if, after your
\emph{client} had entered a plea of `not guilty', you were to test in
cross-examination the reliability of the evidence of the prosecution
witnesses and then address the jury to the effect that the prosecution
had not succeeded in making them sure of your \emph{client's} guilt.
\end{numlist}

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC10}

However, you would be misleading the \emph{court} and would therefore be
in breach of Rules rC5 and rC6 if you were to set up a positive case
inconsistent with the confession, as for example by:
\begin{numlist}\item suggesting to prosecution witnesses, calling your \emph{client} or
your witnesses to show; or submitting to the jury, that your
\emph{client} did not commit the crime; or
\item suggesting that someone else had done so; or
\item putting forward an alibi.
\end{numlist}

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC11}

If there is a risk that the \emph{court} will be misled unless you
disclose confidential information which you have learned in the course
of your \emph{instructions}, you should ask the \emph{client} for
permission to disclose it to the \emph{court}. If your \emph{client}
refuses to allow you to make the disclosure You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} cease to act, and
return your \emph{instructions}: see Rules rC25 to rC27 below. In these
circumstances You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must not}} reveal the information to the \emph{court}.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC12}

For example, if your \emph{client} tells you that they have previous
\emph{convictions} of which the prosecution is not aware, you \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{may not}}
disclose this without their consent. However, in a case where mandatory
sentences apply, the non-disclosure of the previous \emph{convictions}
will result in the \emph{court} failing to pass the sentence that is
required by law. In that situation, You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} advise your \emph{client}
that if consent is refused to your revealing the information you will
have to cease to act. In situations where mandatory sentences do not
apply, and your \emph{client} \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{does not}} agree to disclose the previous
\emph{convictions}, you can continue to represent your \emph{client} but
in doing so \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must not}} say anything that misleads the court. This will
constrain what you can say in mitigation. For example, you could not
advance a positive case of previous good character knowing that there
are undisclosed prior \emph{convictions}. Moreover, if the \emph{court}
asks you a direct question You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must not}} give an untruthful answer and
therefore you would have to withdraw if, on your being asked such a
question, your \emph{client} still refuses to allow you to answer the
question truthfully. You should explain this to your \emph{client}.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC13}

Similarly, if you become aware that your \emph{client} has a document
which should be disclosed but has not been disclosed, you cannot
continue to act unless your \emph{client} agrees to the disclosure of
the document. In these circumstances You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must not}} reveal the existence
or contents of the document to the \emph{court}.

\rulesection{Rule C7-Not abusing your role as an advocate }


\rulesubsection{rc7}

Where you are acting as an advocate, your duty not to abuse your role
includes the following obligations:
\begin{numlist}\item You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must not}} make statements or ask questions merely to insult,
humiliate or annoy a witness or any other person;
\item You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must not}} make a serious allegation against a witness whom you
have had an opportunity to cross-examine unless you have given that
witness a chance to answer the allegation in cross-examination;
\item You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must not}} make a serious allegation against any person, or suggest
that a person is guilty of a crime with which your \emph{client} is
charged unless:
\begin{alphlist}
\item you have reasonable grounds for the allegation; and

\item the allegation is relevant to your \emph{client's} case or the
credibility of a witness; and

\item where the allegation relates to a third party, you avoid naming them
in open \emph{court} unless this is reasonably necessary.
\end{alphlist}
\item You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must not}} put forward to the \emph{court} a personal opinion of
the facts or the law unless you are invited or required to do so by the
\emph{court} or by law.

Your duty to act with honesty and with integrity under  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD3}} includes the
following requirements:
\begin{numlist}\item You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must not}} knowingly or recklessly mislead or attempt to mislead

\item You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} only propose, or accept, fee arrangements which are legal.

\end{numlist}

\guidancesection{Guidance
to Rules C8-C9 and relationship to \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD1}}- \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD5}} }


\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC14}

Your honesty, integrity and independence are fundamental. The interests
of justice (\textcolor{mygold}{\textbf{CD1}}) and the \emph{client's} best interests (\textcolor{mygold}{\textbf{CD2}}) can only
be properly served, and any conflicts between the two properly resolved,
if you conduct yourself honestly and maintain your independence from
external pressures, as required by  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD3}} and  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD4}}. You should also refer to
Rule rC16 which subjects your duty to act in the best interests of your
\emph{client} (\textcolor{mygold}{\textbf{CD2}}) to your observance of  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD3}} and  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD4}}, as well as to
your duty to the \emph{court} (\textcolor{mygold}{\textbf{CD1}}).

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC15}

Other rules deal with specific aspects of your obligation to act in your
\emph{client's} best interests (\textcolor{mygold}{\textbf{CD2}}) while maintaining honesty,
integrity ( \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD3}}) and independence ( \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD4}}), such as rule rC21(1)0 (not acting
where your independence is compromised), rule rC10 (not paying or
accepting \emph{referral fees}) and rC21 (not acting in circumstances of
a conflict of interest or where you risk breaching one \emph{client's}
confidentiality in favour of another's).

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC16}

Rule C8 addresses how your conduct is perceived by the public. Conduct
on your part which the public may reasonably perceive as undermining
your honesty, integrity or independence is likely to diminish the trust
and confidence which the public places in you or in the profession, in
breach of  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD5}}. Rule C9 is not exhaustive of the ways in which  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD5}} may be
breached.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC17}

In addition to your obligation to only propose, or accept, fee
arrangements which are legal in Rule C9(7), You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} also have regard to
your obligations in relation to referral fees in Rule rC10 and the
associated guidance.

\subsection{Examples of how you may be seen as compromising your
independence}

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC18}

The following may reasonably be seen as compromising your independence
in breach of Rule 8 (whether or not the circumstances are such that Rule
rC10 is also breached):
\begin{numlist}\item offering, promising or giving:
\begin{alphlist}\item any commission or referral fee (of whatever size) â€” note that these
are in any case prohibited by Rule rC10 and associated guidance; or
\item a gift (apart from items of modest value),\end{alphlist}

to any \emph{client}, \emph{professional client} or other
\emph{intermediary}; or
\item lending money to any such \emph{client}, \emph{professional client}
or other \emph{intermediary}; or
\item accepting any money (whether as a loan or otherwise) from any
\emph{client}, \emph{professional client} or other \emph{intermediary},
unless it is a payment for your professional services or reimbursement
of expenses or of disbursements made on behalf of the \emph{client};
\end{numlist}

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC19}

If you are offered a gift by a current, prospective or former
\emph{client}, \emph{professional client} or other \emph{intermediary},
you should consider carefully whether the circumstances and size of the
gift would reasonably lead others to think that your independence had
been compromised. If this would be the case, you should refuse to accept
the gift.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC20}

The giving or receiving of entertainment at a disproportionate level may
also give rise to a similar issue and so should not be offered or
accepted if it would lead others reasonably to think that your
independence had been compromised.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC21}

Guidance gC18 to gC20 above is likely to be more relevant where you are
a \emph{self-employed barrister}, a \emph{BSB entity}, an
\emph{authorised (non-BSB) individual}, an \emph{employed barrister (BSB
entity)} or a \emph{manager} of a \emph{BSB entity}. If you are a
\emph{BSB authorised individual} who is a an employee or \emph{manager}
of an \emph{authorised (non-BSB) body} or you are an \emph{employed
barrister (non-authorised body)} and your \emph{approved regulator} or
\emph{employer} (as appropriate) permits payments to which Rule rC10
applies, you may make or receive such payments only in your capacity as
such and as permitted by the rules of your \emph{approved regulator} or
\emph{employer} (as appropriate). For further information on referral
fees, see the guidance at gC32).

\subsection{Media comment}

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC22}

The ethical obligations that apply in relation to your professional
practice generally continue to apply in relation to media comment. In
particular, \emph{barristers} should be aware of the following:
\begin{enumerate}[label=â€¢]
\item Client's best interests: Core Duty 2 and Rules C15(1)-(2) require a
barrister to promote fearlessly and by all proper and lawful means the
lay \emph{client's} best interests and to do so without regard to their
own interests.

\item Independence: Core Duties 3 and 4 provide that You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must not}} permit
your absolute independence, integrity and freedom from external
pressures to be compromised.

\item Trust and confidence: Core Duty 5 provides that You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must not}} behave in
a way which is likely to diminish the trust and confidence which the
public places in you or the profession.

\item Confidentiality: Core Duty 6 and Rule C15(5) require you to preserve
the confidentiality of your lay client's affairs and You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must not}}
undermine this unless permitted to do so by law or with the express
consent of the lay client.

\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Examples of what your duty to act with honesty and integrity may
require}

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC23}

Rule rC9 sets out some specific aspects of your duty under  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD3}} to act
with honesty and also with integrity.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC24}

In addition to the above, where the other side is legally represented
and you are conducting correspondence in respect of the particular
matter, you are expected to correspond at all times with that other
party's legal representative â€” otherwise you may be regarded as
breaching  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD3}} or Rule C9.

\subsection{Other possible breaches of  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD3}} and/or  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD5}}}

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC25}

A breach of Rule rC9 may also constitute a breach of  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD3}} and/or  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD5}}.
Other conduct which is likely to be treated as a breach of  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD3}} and/or
 \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD5}} includes (but is not limited to):
\begin{numlist}\item subject to Guidance C27~below, breaches of Rule rC8;
\item breaches of Rule rC10;
\item criminal conduct, other than \emph{minor criminal offences} (see
Guidance C27);
\item seriously offensive or discreditable conduct towards third parties;
\item dishonesty;
\item unlawful \emph{victimisation} or \emph{harassment}; or
\item abuse of your professional position.
\end{numlist}
\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC26}

For the purposes of Guidance gC25(7) above, referring to your status as a
\emph{barrister}, for example on professional notepaper, in a context
where it is irrelevant, such as in a private dispute, may well
constitute abuse of your professional position and thus involve a breach
of  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD3}} and/or  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD5}}.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC27}

Conduct which is not likely to be treated as a breach of Rules rC8 or
rC9, or  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD3}} or  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD5}}, includes (but is not limited to):
\begin{numlist}\item \emph{minor criminal offences};
\item your conduct in your private or personal life, unless this involves:
\begin{alphlist}\item abuse of your professional position; or
\item committing a \emph{criminal offence}, other than a \emph{minor
criminal offence}.\end{alphlist}
\end{numlist}

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC28}

For the purpose of Guidance C27 above, \emph{minor criminal offences}
include:
\begin{numlist}\item an offence committed in the United Kingdom which is a fixed-penalty
offence under the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988; or
\item an offence committed in the United Kingdom or abroad which is dealt
with by a procedure substantially similar to that for such a
fixed-penalty offence; or
\item an offence whose main ingredient is the unlawful parking of a motor
vehicle.

to which the \emph{client} has not consented may constitute a bribe and

\end{numlist}

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC31}

\emph{Referral fees} and inducements (as defined in the Criminal Justice
and Courts Act 2015) are prohibited where they relate to a claim or
potential claim for damages for personal injury or death or arise out of
circumstances involving personal injury or death personal injury claims:
section 56 Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012
and section 58 Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015. Rule rC10 \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{does not}}
prohibit proper expenses that are not a reward for referring work, such
as genuine and reasonable payments for:
\begin{numlist}\item clerking and administrative services (including where these are
outsourced);
\item membership subscriptions to ADR bodies that appoint or recommend a
person to provide mediation, arbitration or adjudication services; or
\item advertising and publicity, which are payable whether or not any work
is referred. However, the fact that a fee varies with the amount of work
received \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{does not}} necessarily mean that that it is a \emph{referral
fee}, if it is genuinely for a marketing service from someone who is not
directing work to one provider rather than another, depending on who
pays more.

Your duty to act in the best interests of each \emph{client} (\textcolor{mygold}{\textbf{CD2}}), to
provide a competent standard of work and service to each \emph{client}
( \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD7}}) and to keep the affairs of each \emph{client} confidential ( \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD6}})
includes the following obligations:
\begin{numlist}\item You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} promote fearlessly and by all proper and lawful means the
\emph{client's} best interests;
\item You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} do so without regard to your own interests or to any
consequences to you (which may include, for the avoidance of doubt, you
being required to take reasonable steps to mitigate the effects of any
breach of this \emph{Handbook});
\item You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} do so without regard to the consequences to any other person
(whether to your \emph{professional client}, \emph{employer} or any
other person);
\item You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must not}} permit your \emph{professional client}, \emph{employer}
or any other person to limit your discretion as to how the interests of
the \emph{client} can best be served; and
\item You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} protect the confidentiality of each \emph{client's} affairs,
except for such disclosures as are required or permitted by law or to
which your \emph{client} gives informed consent.
\end{numlist}

\rulesubsubsection{rc16}

Your duty to act in the best interests of each \emph{client} (\textcolor{mygold}{\textbf{CD2}}) is
subject to your duty to the \emph{court} (\textcolor{mygold}{\textbf{CD1}}) and to your obligations
to act with honesty, and with integrity ( \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD3}}) and to maintain your
independence ( \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD4}}).


\guidancesection{Guidance

--
C16 and relationship to \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD2}} and  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD6}}- \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD7}} }


\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC36}

Your duty is to your \emph{client}, not to your \emph{professional
client} or other \emph{intermediary} (if any).

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC37}

Rules rC15 and rC16 are expressed in terms of the interests of each
\emph{client}. This is because you may only accept \emph{instructions}
to act for more than one \emph{client} if you are able to act in the
best interests of each \emph{client} as if that \emph{client} were your
only \emph{client}, as \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD2}} requires of you. See further Rule rC17 on the
circumstances when you are obliged to advise your \emph{client} to seek
other legal representation and Rules rC21(2) and rC21(3) on conflicts of
interest and the guidance to those rules at gC69.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC38}

 \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD7}} requires not only that you provide a competent standard of work but
also a competent standard of service to your \emph{client}. Rule rC15 is
not exhaustive of what You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} do to ensure your compliance with \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD2}}
and  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD7}}. By way of example, a competent standard of work and of service
also includes:
\begin{numlist}\item treating each \emph{client} with courtesy and consideration; and
\item seeking to advise your \emph{client}, in terms they can understand;
and
\item taking all reasonable steps to avoid incurring unnecessary expense;
and
\item reading your instructions promptly. This may be important if there is
a time limit or limitation period. If you fail to read your instructions
promptly, it is possible that you will not be aware of the time limit
until it is too late.
\end{numlist}

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC39}

In order to be able to provide a competent standard of work, you should
keep your professional knowledge and skills up to date, regularly take
part in professional development and educational activities that
maintain and further develop your competence and performance and, where
you are a \emph{BSB entity} or a \emph{manager} of such body, you should
take reasonable steps to ensure that \emph{managers} and employees
within your organisation undertake such training. Merely complying with
the Continuing Professional Development requirements \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{may not}} be
sufficient to comply with Rule rC15. You should also ensure that you
comply with any specific training requirements of the \emph{Bar
Standards Board} before undertaking certain activities â€” for example,
you should not attend a police station to advise a suspect or
interviewee as to the handling and conduct of police interviews unless
you have complied with the following training requirements imposed by
the \emph{Bar Standards Board}: \emph{barristers} undertaking publicly
funded police station work under a criminal contract \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} comply with
the training requirements specified by the Legal Aid Agency.
\emph{Barristers} undertaking privately funded police station work \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}}
complete the Police Station Qualification (``PSQ'') and (if they do not
hold higher rights of audience) the Magistrates Court Qualification.
Similarly, you should not undertake public access work without
successfully completing the required training specified by the \emph{Bar
Standards Board}.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC40}

In addition to Guidance gC38 above, a \emph{BSB entity} or a
\emph{manager} of such body should ensure that work is allocated
appropriately, to \emph{managers} and/or employees with the appropriate
knowledge and expertise to undertake such work.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC41}

You should remember that your \emph{client} \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{may not}} be familiar with
legal proceedings and may find them difficult and stressful. You should
do what you reasonably can to ensure that the \emph{client} understands
the process and what to expect from it and from you. You should also try
to avoid any unnecessary distress for your \emph{client}. This is
particularly important where you are dealing with a vulnerable
\emph{client}.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC42}

The duty of confidentiality ( \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD6}}) is central to the administration of
justice. \emph{Clients} who put their confidence in their legal advisers
must be able to do so in the knowledge that the information they give,
or which is given on their behalf, will stay confidential. In normal
circumstances, this information will be privileged and not disclosed to
a \emph{court}.  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD6}}, rC4 and Guidance gC8 and gC11 to gC13 provide
further information.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC43}

Rule rC15(5) acknowledges that your duty of confidentiality is subject to
an exception if disclosure is required or permitted by law. For example,
you may be obliged to disclose certain matters by the Proceeds of Crime
Act 2002. Disclosure in those circumstances would not amount to a breach
of  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD6}} or Rule rC15(5) In other circumstances, you may only make
disclosure of confidential information where your \emph{client} gives
informed consent to the disclosure. See the Guidance to Rule rC21 at
gC69~for an example of circumstances where it may be appropriate for you
to seek such consent.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC44}

There may be circumstances when your duty of confidentiality to your
\emph{client} conflicts with your duty to the \emph{court}. Rule rC4 and
Guidance gC8 and gC11 to gC13 provide further information.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC45}

Similarly, there may be circumstances when your duty of confidentiality
to your \emph{client} conflicts with your duty to your regulator. Rule
rC64 and Guidance gC92 in respect of that rule provide further
information. In addition, Rule rC66 may also apply.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC46}

If you are a \emph{pupil} of, or are \emph{devilling} work for, a
\emph{self-employed barrister}, Rule rC15(5) applies to you as if the
\emph{client} of the \emph{self-employed barrister} was your own
\emph{client}.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC47}

The section You and Your Practice, at 2(c)5, provides for duties
regarding the systems and procedures You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} put in place and enforce
in order to ensure compliance with Rule rC15(5).

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC48}

If you are an \emph{authorised individual} or a \emph{manager} working
in a \emph{BSB entity} your personal duty to act in the best interests
of your \emph{client} requires you to assist in the redistribution of
\emph{client} files and otherwise assisting to ensure each
\emph{client's} interests are protected in the event that the \emph{BSB
entity} itself is unable to do so for whatever reason (for example,
insolvency).

\rulesection{Rule
C17}

\rulesubsubsection{rc17}

Your duty to act in the best interests of each \emph{client} (\textcolor{mygold}{\textbf{CD2}})
includes a duty to consider whether the \emph{client's} best interests
are served by different legal representation, and if so, to advise the
\emph{client} to that effect.


\guidancesection{Guidance
to Rule C17 }


\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC49}

Your duty to comply with Rule rC17 may require you to advise your
\emph{client} that in their best interests they should be represented
by:
\begin{numlist}
\item a different advocate or legal representative, whether more senior or
more junior than you, or with different experience from yours;

\item more than one advocate or legal representative;

\item fewer advocates or legal representatives than have been instructed;
or

\item in the case where you are acting through a \emph{professional
client}, different \emph{solicitors}.
\end{numlist}
\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC50}

Specific rules apply where you are acting on a public access basis,
which oblige you to consider whether \emph{solicitors} should also be
instructed. As to these see the public access rules at Section 2(d)2 and
further in respect of \emph{BSB entities} Rule S28 and the associated
guidance.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC51}

CD2 and Rules rC15(5) and rC17 require you, subject to Rule rC16, to put
your \emph{client's} interests ahead of your own and those of any other
person. If you consider that your \emph{professional client}, another
\emph{solicitor} or \emph{intermediary}, another \emph{barrister}, or
any other person acting on behalf of your \emph{client} has been
negligent, you should ensure that your \emph{client} is advised of this.

as reasonably possible in sufficient time to enable appropriate steps to
be taken to protect the \emph{client's} interests, if:
\begin{numlist}\item it becomes apparent to you that you will not be able to carry out the

C19\quad Not misleading clients and potential clients }


\rulesubsubsection{rc19}

If you supply, or offer to supply, \emph{legal services}, You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must not}}
mislead, or cause or permit to be misled, any person to whom you supply,
or offer to supply, \emph{legal services} about:
\begin{numlist}\item the nature and scope of the \emph{legal services} which you are
offering or agreeing to supply;
\item the terms on which the \emph{legal services} will be supplied, who
will carry out the work and the basis of charging;
\item who is legally responsible for the provision of the services;
\item whether you are entitled to supply those services and the extent to
which you are regulated when providing those services and by whom; or
\item the extent to which you are covered by insurance against claims for
professional negligence.
\end{numlist}
\guidancesection{Guidance
to Rule C19 }


\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC53}

The best interests of \emph{clients} (\textcolor{mygold}{\textbf{CD2}}) and public confidence in the
profession ( \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD5}}) are undermined if there is a lack of clarity as to
whether services are regulated, who is supplying them, on what terms,
and what redress \emph{clients} have and against whom if things go
wrong. Rule rC19 may potentially be infringed in a broad variety of
situations. You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} consider how matters will appear to the
\emph{client}.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC54}

\emph{Clients} may, by way of example, be misled if \emph{self-employed
barristers} were to share premises with \emph{solicitors} or other
professionals without making sufficiently clear to \emph{clients} that
they remain separate and independent from one another and are not
responsible for one another's work.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC55}

Likewise, it is likely to be necessary to make clear to \emph{clients}
that any entity established as a ``ProcureCo'' is not itself able to
supply \emph{reserved legal activities} and is not subject to regulation
by the \emph{Bar Standards Board}.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC56}

A set of \emph{chambers} dealing directly with unsophisticated lay
\emph{clients} might breach Rule rC19 if its branding created the
appearance of an entity or \emph{partnership} and it failed to explain
that the members of \emph{chambers} are, in fact, self-employed
individuals who are not responsible for one another's work.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC57}

Knowingly or recklessly publishing advertising material which is
inaccurate or likely to mislead could also result in you being in breach
of Rule rC19. You should be particularly careful about making
comparisons with other persons as these may often be regarded as
misleading.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC58}

If you carry out public access work but are not authorised to
\emph{conduct litigation}, you would breach Rule rC19 if you caused or
permitted your \emph{client} to be misled into believing that you are
entitled to, or will, provide services that include the \emph{conduct of
litigation} on behalf of your \emph{client}.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC59}

If you are a \emph{self-employed barrister}, you would, for example,
likely be regarded as having breached Rule rC19 if you charged at your
own hourly rate for work done by a \emph{devil} or \emph{pupil}.
Moreover, such conduct may well breach your duty to act with honesty and
also with integrity ( \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD3}}).

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC60}

If you are an \emph{unregistered barrister}, you would breach Rule rC19
if you misled your \emph{client} into thinking that you were providing
\emph{legal services} to them as a \emph{barrister} or that you were
subject to the same regulation as a \emph{practising barrister}. You
would also breach the rule if you implied that you were covered by
insurance if you were not, or if you suggested that your \emph{clients}
could seek a remedy from the \emph{Bar Standards Board} or the
\emph{Legal Ombudsman} if they were dissatisfied with the services you
provided. You should also be aware of the rules set out in Section D4~of
this Code of Conduct and the additional guidance for \emph{unregistered
barristers} available on the \emph{Bar Standards Board} website.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC61}

Rule C19(3) is particularly relevant where you act in more than one
capacity, for example as a \emph{BSB authorised individual} as well as a
manager or employee of an \emph{authorised (non BSB) body}. This is
because you should make it clear to each \emph{client} in what capacity
you are acting and, therefore, who has legal responsibility for the
provision of the services.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC62}

If you are a \emph{pupil}, you should not hold yourself out as a member
of \emph{chambers} or permit your name to appear as such. You should
ensure the \emph{client} understands your status.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC63}

A number of other rules impose positive obligations on you, in
particular circumstances, to make clear your regulatory status and the
basis and terms on which you are acting. See, for example, Rule rC23 and
guidance gC74.

\rulesection{Rule
C20\quad Personal responsibility }


\rulesubsubsection{rc20}

Where you are a \emph{BSB authorised individual}, you are personally
responsible for your own conduct and for your professional work. You
must use your own professional judgment in relation to those matters on
which you are instructed and be able to justify your decisions and
actions. You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} do this notwithstanding the views of your
\emph{client}, \emph{professional client}, \emph{employer} or any other
person.


\guidancesection{Guidance
to Rule C20 }


\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC64}

It is fundamental that \emph{BSB authorised individuals} and
\emph{authorised (non-BSB) individuals} are personally responsible for
their own conduct and for their own professional work, whether they are
acting in a self-employed or employed capacity (in the case of \emph{BSB
authorised individuals}) or as an employee or \emph{manager} of a
\emph{BSB entity} (in the case of \emph{authorised (non-BSB)
individuals}).

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC65}

Nothing in Rule rC20 is intended to prevent you from delegating or
outsourcing to any other person discrete tasks (for example, research)
which such other person is well-equipped to provide. However, where such
tasks are delegated or outsourced, you remain personally responsible for
such work. Further, in circumstances where such tasks are being
outsourced, Rule rC86 which deals with outsourcing, \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} be complied
with.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC66}

You are responsible for the service provided by all those who represent
you in your dealings with your \emph{client}, including your clerks or
any other employees or agents.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC67}

Nothing in this rule or guidance prevents a \emph{BSB entity} from
contracting on the basis that any civil liability for the services
provided by a \emph{BSB regulated individual} lies with the \emph{BSB
entity} and the \emph{BSB regulated individual} is not to be liable.
However, any such stipulation as to civil liability \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{does not}} affect the
regulatory obligations of the \emph{BSB regulated individual} including
(but not limited to) that of being personally responsible under Rule
rC20 for the professional judgments made.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC68}

See, further, guidance to Rule rC19, as regards work by \emph{pupils}
and \emph{devils} Rule rC15, gC124 and Rule rC86 (on outsourcing).

\rulesubsubsection{rc21}

You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must not}} accept \emph{instructions} to act in a particular matter
if:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
\item due to any existing or previous \emph{instructions} you are not able
to fulfil your obligation to act in the best interests of the

\item there is a conflict of interest, or real risk of conflict of

\item there is a conflict of interest, or real risk of conflict of
interest, between the prospective \emph{client} and one or more of your
former or existing \emph{clients} in respect of the particular matter
unless all of the \emph{clients} who have an interest in the particular
matter give their informed consent to your acting in such circumstances;
or

\item there is a real risk that information confidential to another former
or existing \emph{client}, or any other person to whom you owe duties of
confidence, may be relevant to the matter, such that if, obliged to
maintain confidentiality, you could not act in the best interests of the
prospective \emph{client}, and the former or existing \emph{client} or
person to whom you owe that duty \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{does not}} give informed consent to
disclosure of that confidential information; or

\item your instructions seek to limit your ordinary authority or discretion
in the conduct of proceedings in \emph{court}; or

\item your instructions require you to act other than in accordance with
law or with the provisions of this \emph{Handbook}; or

\item you are not authorised and/or otherwise accredited to perform the
work required by the relevant \emph{instruction}; or

\item you are not competent to handle the particular matter or otherwise do
not have enough experience to handle the matter; or

\item you do not have enough time to deal with the particular matter,
unless the circumstances are such that it would nevertheless be in the
\emph{client's} best interests for you to accept; or

\item there is a real prospect that you are not going to be able to
maintain your independence.

Rules rC21(2), rC21(3) and rC21(4) are intended to reflect the law on
conflict of interests and confidentiality and what is required of you by

independently ( \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD4}}), and maintaining \emph{client} confidentiality
( \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD6}}). You are prohibited from acting where there is a conflict of
interest between your own personal interests and the interests of a
prospective \emph{client}. However, where there is a conflict of
interest between an existing \emph{client} or \emph{clients} and a
prospective \emph{client} or \emph{clients} or two or more prospective
\emph{clients}, you may be entitled to accept instructions or to
continue to act on a particular matter where you have fully disclosed to
the relevant \emph{clients} and prospective \emph{clients} (as
appropriate) the extent and nature of the conflict; they have each
provided their informed consent to you acting; and you are able to act
in the best interests of each \emph{client} and independently as
required by \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD2}} and  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD4}}.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC70}

Examples of where you may be required to refuse to accept
\emph{instructions} in accordance with Rule rC21(7) include:
\begin{numlist}\item where the \emph{instructions} relate to the provision of litigation
services and you have not been authorised to \emph{conduct litigation}

\item removed
\item where the matter would require you to conduct correspondence with
parties other than your \emph{client} (in the form of letters, faxes,
emails or the like), you do not have adequate systems, experience or
resources for managing appropriately such correspondence and/or you do
not have adequate insurance in place in accordance with Rule rC75 which
covers, amongst other things, any loss suffered by the \emph{client} as
a result of the conduct of such correspondence.

Rule rC21(9) recognises that there may be exceptional circumstances when
\emph{instructions} are delivered so late that no suitable, competent
advocate would have adequate time to prepare. In those cases you~are not
required to refuse \emph{instructions} as it will be in the
\emph{client's} best interests that you accept. Indeed, if you are
obliged under the cab rank rule to accept the \emph{instructions}, you
must do so.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC73}

Rule rC21(1)0 is an aspect of your broader obligation to maintain your
independence ( \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD4}}). Your ability to perform your duty to the
\emph{court} (\textcolor{mygold}{\textbf{CD1}}) and act in the best interests of your \emph{client}
(\textcolor{mygold}{\textbf{CD2}}) may be put at risk if you act in circumstances where your
independence is compromised. Examples of when you \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{may not}} be able to
maintain your independence include appearing as an advocate in a matter
in which you are likely to be called as a witness (unless the matter on
which you are likely to be called as a witness is peripheral or minor in
the context of the litigation as a whole and is unlikely to lead to your
involvement in the matter being challenged at a later date). If it
appears that you are likely to be a witness on a material question of
fact, and therefore \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} withdraw from a case as there is a real
prospect that you are not going to be able to maintain your independence
(Rules C21(1)0 and C25), You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} also comply with Rule C27.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC74}

Where the \emph{instructions} relate to public access or licensed access
work and you are a \emph{self-employed barrister} you will also need to
have regard to the relevant rules at 2(d)2. If you are a \emph{BSB
entity}, you should have regard to the guidance to Rule S28.

}


\rulesubsubsection{rc22}

Where you first accept \emph{instructions} to act in a matter:
\begin{numlist}\item you \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}}, subject to Rule rC23, confirm in writing acceptance of the
\emph{instructions} and the terms and/or basis on which you will be
acting, including the basis of charging;
\item where your instructions are from a \emph{professional client}, the
confirmation required by rC22(1) \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} be sent to the \emph{professional
client};
\item where your instructions are from a \emph{client}, the confirmation
required by rC22(1) \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} be sent to the \emph{client}.
\item if you are a \emph{BSB entity}, You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} ensure that the terms under
which you accept instructions from \emph{clients} include consent from
clients to disclose and give control of files to the \emph{Bar Standards
Board} or its agent in circumstances where the conditions in rS113(5) are
met.\end{numlist}


\rulesubsubsection{rc23}

In the event that, following your acceptance of the \emph{instructions}
in accordance with Rule rC22, the scope of the \emph{instructions} is
varied by the relevant \emph{client} (including where the \emph{client}
instructs you on additional aspects relating to the same matter), you
are not required to confirm again in writing acceptance of the
instructions or the terms and/or basis upon which you will be acting. In
these circumstances, you will be deemed to have accepted the
instructions when you begin the work, on the same terms or basis as
before, unless otherwise specified.

\rulesubsubsection{rc24}

You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} comply with the requirements set out in Rules rC22 and rC23
before doing the work unless that is not reasonably practicable, in
which case you should do so as soon as reasonably practicable.


\guidancesection{Guidance

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC75}

Compliance with the requirement in Rule rC22 to set out the terms and/or
basis upon which you will be acting may be achieved by including a
reference or link to the relevant terms in your written communication of
acceptance. You may, for example, refer the \emph{client} or
\emph{professional client} (as the case may be) to the terms of service
set out on your website or to standard terms of service set out on
the~\emph{Bar Council's} website (in which regard, please also refer to
the guidance on the use of the standard terms of service). Where you
agree to do your work on terms and conditions that have been proposed to
you by the \emph{client} or by the \emph{professional client}, you
should confirm in writing that that is the basis on which your work is
done. Where there are competing sets of terms and conditions, which
terms have been agreed and are the basis of your retainer will be a
matter to be determined in accordance with the law of contract.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC76}

Your obligation under Rule rC23 is to ensure that the basis on which you
act has been defined, which \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{does not}} necessarily mean governed by your
own contractual terms. In circumstances where Rule rC23 applies, you
should take particular care to ensure that the \emph{client} is clear
about the basis for charging for any variation to the work where it may
be unclear. You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} also ensure that you comply with the requirements
of the Provision of Services Regulations 2009. See, further Rule rC19
(not misleading \emph{clients} or prospective \emph{clients}) and the
guidance to that rule at gC52 to gC62.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC77}

If you are a \emph{self-employed barrister} a clerk may confirm on your
behalf your acceptance of \emph{instructions} in accordance with Rules
rC22 and rC23 above.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC78}

When accepting instructions, You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} also ensure that you comply with
the complaints handling rules set out in Section 2(d).

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC79}

When accepting instructions in accordance with Rule rC22, confirmation
by email will satisfy any requirement for written acceptance.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC80}

You may have been instructed in relation to a discrete and finite task,
such as to provide an opinion on a particular issue, or to provide
ongoing services, for example, to conduct particular litigation. Your
confirmation of acceptance of instructions under Rule rC22 should make
clear the scope of the \emph{instructions} you are accepting, whether by
cross-referring to the \emph{instructions}, where these are in writing
or by summarising your understanding of the scope of work you are
instructed to undertake.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC81}

Disputes about costs are one of the most frequent \emph{complaints}. The
provision of clear information before work starts is the best way of
avoiding such \emph{complaints}. The \emph{Legal Ombudsman} has produced
a useful guide ``An Ombudsman's view of good costs service'' which can
be found on its website.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC82}

Where the \emph{instructions} relate to public access or licensed access
work and you are a \emph{self-employed barrister}, you will also need to
have regard to the relevant rules at 2(d)2. If you are a \emph{BSB

You \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} cease to act and return your \emph{instructions} promptly. In

\begin{numlist}\item in a case funded by the \emph{Legal Aid Agency} as part of Criminal
Legal Aid or Civil Legal Aid it has become apparent to you that this

\item the \emph{client} refuses to authorise you to make some disclosure to
the \emph{court} which your duty to the \emph{court} requires you to

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC83}

In deciding whether to cease to act and to return existing instructions
in accordance with Rule rC26, you should, where possible and subject to
your overriding duty to the \emph{court}, ensure that the \emph{client}
is not adversely affected because there is not enough time to engage
other adequate legal assistance.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC84}

If you are working on a referral basis and your \emph{professional
client} withdraws, you are no longer instructed and cannot continue to
act unless appointed by the \emph{court}, or you otherwise receive new
instructions. You will not be bound by the cab rank rule if appointed by
the court. For these purposes working on a ``referral basis'' means
where a \emph{professional client} instructs a \emph{BSB authorised
individual} to provide \emph{legal services} on behalf of one of that
\emph{professional client's} own clients

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC85}

You should not rely on Rule rC26(3) to break an engagement to supply
legal services so that you can attend or fulfil a non-professional
engagement of any kind other than those indicated in Rule rC26(3).

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC86}

When considering whether or not you are required to return instructions
in accordance with Rule rC26(6) you should have regard to relevant case
law including: English \& American Insurance Co Ltd \& Others -v-

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC87}

If a fundamental change is made to the basis of your remuneration, you
should treat such a change as though your original instructions have

circumstances, you are not to be regarded as returning your

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC88}

As a matter of general law you have an obligation not to discriminate
unlawfully as to those to whom you make your services available on any
of the statutorily prohibited grounds such as gender or race. See the
Equality Rules in the BSB Handbook and the BSB's website for guidance as
to your obligations in respect of equality and diversity. This rule of
conduct is concerned with a broader obligation not to withhold your
services on grounds that are inherently inconsistent with your role in
upholding access to justice and the rule of law and therefore in this
rule ``discriminate'' is used in this broader sense. This obligation
applies whether or not the \emph{client} is a member of any protected
group for the purposes of the Equality Act 2010. For example, you \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}}
not withhold services on the ground that any financial support which may
properly be given to the prospective \emph{client} for the proceedings
in question will be available as part of Criminal Legal Aid and Civil

Rule rC30 means that you would not be required to accept
\emph{instructions} to, for example, \emph{conduct litigation} or attend
a police station in circumstances where you do not normally undertake
such work or, in the case of litigation, are not authorised to undertake
such work.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC90}

In determining whether or not a fee is proper for the purposes of Rule
C30(8), regard shall be had to the following:
\begin{numlist}\item the complexity length and difficulty of the case;
\item your ability, experience and seniority; and
\item the expenses which you will incur.
\end{numlist}
\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC91}

Further, you may refuse to accept instructions on the basis that the fee
is not proper if the instructions are on the basis that you will do the
work under a \emph{conditional fee agreement} or damages based
agreement.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC91A}

Examples of when you might reasonably conclude (subject to the following
paragraph) that a \emph{professional client} represents an unacceptable
credit risk for the purposes of Rule C30(7)(b) include:
\begin{numlist}\item Where they are included on the \emph{Bar Council's} List of
Defaulting Solicitors;
\item Where to your knowledge a \emph{barrister} has obtained a judgment
against a \emph{professional client}, which remains unpaid;
\item Where a firm or sole practitioner is subject to insolvency
proceedings, an individual voluntary arrangement or partnership
voluntary arrangement; or
\item Where there is evidence of other unsatisfied judgments that
reasonably call into question the \emph{professional client's} ability
to pay your fees.\end{numlist}


Even where you consider that there is a serious credit risk, you should
not conclude that the \emph{professional client} represents an
unacceptable credit risk without first considering alternatives. This
will include considering whether the credit risk could be mitigated in
other ways, for example by seeking payment of the fee in advance or
payment into a third party payment service as permitted by rC74, rC75
and associated guidance.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC91B}

The standard terms referred to in Rule C30(9)(c) may be drafted as if the
\emph{professional client} were an \emph{authorised person} regulated by
the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA). However, the cab rank rule
applies (subject to the various exceptions in Rule C30) to instructions
from any \emph{professional client}, therefore you may be instructed
under the cab rank rule by \emph{authorised persons} who are regulated
by another \emph{approved regulator}.

The BSB expects all \emph{authorised persons} to be able to access the
cab rank rule on behalf of their \emph{clients} in the same way.
Therefore, if you are instructed by an \emph{authorised person} who is
not regulated by the SRA, you are obliged to act on the same terms. You
should therefore apply the standard terms referred to in Rule C30(9)(c) as
if \begin{romlist}
\item the definition of \emph{professional client} includes that
\emph{authorised person}, and \item any references to the SRA or its
regulatory arrangements~are references to that person's \emph{approved

entitled to serve you with a notice for production of those documents.

Where you are being required to report serious misconduct by others and
legal professional privilege applies, this will override the requirement
to report serious misconduct by another. However, the BSB may
subsequently serve you with a notice for production of documents in
which case the same principles set out above apply.

For the avoidance of doubt, none of this casts any doubt on your

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC95}

It is in the public interest that the \emph{Bar Standards Board}, as an
\emph{Approved Regulator}, is made aware of, and is able to investigate,
potential instances of serious misconduct. The purpose of Rules rC65(7)
to rC69, therefore, is to assist the \emph{Bar Standards Board} in
undertaking this regulatory function.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC96}

Serious misconduct includes, without being limited to:
\begin{numlist}\item dishonesty ( \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD3}});
\item assault or harassment ( \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD3}} and/or  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD5}} and/or  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD8}});
\item seeking to gain access without consent to \emph{instructions} or
other confidential information relating to the opposing party's case
( \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD3}} and/or  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD5}}); or
\item seeking to gain access without consent to confidential information
relating to another member of \emph{chambers}, member of staff or
\emph{pupil} ( \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD3}} and/or  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD5}});
\item encouraging a witness to give evidence which is untruthful or
misleading (CD1 and/or  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD3}});
\item knowingly or recklessly misleading, or attempting to mislead, the
\emph{court} or an opponent (CD1 and/ or  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD3}}); or
\item being drunk or under the influence of drugs in \emph{court} (CD2
and/or  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD7}}); or
\item failure to report promptly to the \emph{Bar Standards Board} pursuant
to rC65(1)-rC65(5) and/or rC66 above or if;
\begin{enumerate}[label=â€¢]
\item \emph{director's disqualification} proceedings are initiated against
you;

\item a \emph{director's disqualification} order is made against you;

\item winding up proceedings are initiated in respect of or against you;

\item you have had an administrator, administrative receiver, receiver or
liquidator appointed in respect of you;

\item administration proceedings are initiated in respect of or against you;

\end{enumerate}
\item a breach of rC67 above; for example, reporting, or threatening to
report, another \emph{person} as a litigation tactic or otherwise
abusively; or merely to please a \emph{client} or any other
\emph{person} or otherwise for an improper motive;~
\item conduct that poses a serious risk to the public.
\end{numlist}
\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC97}

If you believe (or suspect) that there has been serious misconduct, then
the first step is to carefully consider all of the circumstances. The
circumstances include:
\begin{numlist}\item whether that person's \emph{instructions} or other confidential
matters might have a bearing on the assessment of their conduct;
\item whether that person has been offered an opportunity to explain their
conduct, and if not, why not;
\item any explanation which has been or could be offered for that person's
conduct;
\item whether the matter has been raised, or will be raised, in the
litigation in which it occurred, and if not, why not.
\end{numlist}
\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC98}

Having considered all of the circumstances, the duty to report arises if
you have reasonable grounds to believe there has been serious
misconduct. This will be so where, having given due consideration to the
circumstances, including the matters identified at Guidance gC97, you
have material before you which as it stands establishes a reasonably
credible case of serious misconduct. Your duty under Rule rC66 is then
to report the potential instance of serious misconduct so that the
\emph{Bar Standards Board} can investigate whether or not there has in
fact been misconduct.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC99}

Circumstances which may give rise to the exception from the general
requirement to report serious misconduct set out in Rule rC68(1) include
for example where misconduct has been widely reported~in the national
media. In these circumstances it would not be in the public interest for
every \emph{BSB regulated person} and \emph{unregistered barrister} to
have an obligation to report such serious misconduct.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC100}

In Rule rC68(4) ``work on the \emph{Bar Council} advice line'' means:
\begin{numlist}
\item dealing with queries from \emph{BSB regulated persons} and
\emph{unregistered barristers} who contact an advice line operated by
the \emph{Bar Council} for the purposes of providing advice to those
persons; and

\item either providing advice to \emph{BSB regulated persons} and
\emph{unregistered barristers} in the course of working for an advice
line or to any individual working for an advice line where \begin{romlist}\item you are
identified on the list of \emph{BSB regulated persons} maintained by the
\emph{Bar Council} as being permitted to provide such advice (the
``approved list''); and \item the advice which you are being asked to
provide to the individual working for an advice line arises from a query
which originated from their work for that service; and\end{romlist}

\item providing advice to \emph{BSB regulated persons} and
\emph{unregistered barristers} where any individual working for an
advice line arranges for you to give such advice and you are on the
approved list.

\item for the purposes of Rule C68, the relevant advice lines are:
\begin{enumerate}[label=--]
    \item  the Ethical Queries Helpline;

\item the Equality and Diversity Helpline;

\item the Remuneration Helpline; and

\item the Pupillage Helpline.
\end{enumerate}
\end{numlist}
\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC101}

Rule rC68(4) has been carved out of the general requirement to report
serious misconduct of others because it is not in the public interest
that the duty to report misconduct should constrain \emph{BSB regulated
persons} or \emph{unregistered barristers} appointed by or on behalf of
the \emph{Bar Council} to offer ethical advice to others from doing so
or inhibit \emph{BSB regulated persons} or \emph{unregistered
barristers} needing advice from seeking it. Consequently, \emph{BSB
regulated persons} or \emph{unregistered barristers} appointed by or on
behalf of the \emph{Bar Council} to offer ethical advice to \emph{BSB
regulated persons} or \emph{unregistered barristers} through a specified
advice service will not be under a duty to report information received
by them in confidence from persons seeking such advice, subject only to
the requirements of the general law. However, in circumstances where
Rule C68(4) applies, the relevant \emph{BSB regulated person} or
\emph{unregistered barrister} will still be expected to encourage the
relevant \emph{BSB regulated person} or \emph{unregistered barrister}
who has committed serious misconduct to disclose such serious misconduct
to the \emph{Bar Standards Board} in accordance with Rule C65(7).

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC102}

Misconduct which falls short of serious misconduct should, where
applicable, be reported to your HOLP so that they can keep a record of
non-compliance in accordance with Rule rC96(4).

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC103}

The prohibition in Rule rC73 applies to you and to anyone acting on your
behalf, including any ``ProcureCo'' being a company established as a
vehicle to enable the provision of \emph{legal services} but \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{does not}} in
itself supply or provide those \emph{legal services}. Rule rC73
prohibits you from holding \emph{client money} or other \emph{client}
assets yourself, or through any agent, third party or nominee.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC104}

Receiving, controlling or handling \emph{client money} includes entering
into any arrangement which gives you de facto control over the use
and/or destination of funds provided by or for the benefit of your
\emph{client} or intended by another party to be transmitted to your
\emph{client}, whether or not those funds are beneficially owned by your
client and whether or not held in an account of yours.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC105}

The circumstances in which you will have de facto control within the
meaning of Rule rC73 include when you can cause money to be transferred
from a balance standing to the credit of your \emph{client} without that
\emph{client's} consent to such a withdrawal. For large withdrawals,
explicit consent should usually be required. However, the
\emph{client's} consent may be deemed to be given if:
\begin{numlist}\item the \emph{client} has given informed consent to an arrangement which
enables withdrawals to be made after the \emph{client} has received an
invoice; and
\item the \emph{client} has not objected to the withdrawal within a
pre-agreed reasonable period (which should not normally be less than one
week from receipt of the invoice).
\end{numlist}

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC106}

A fixed fee paid in advance is not \emph{client money} for the purposes
of Rule rC73.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC107}

If you have decided in principle to take a particular case you may
request an `upfront' fixed fee from your prospective \emph{client}
before finally agreeing to work on their behalf. This should only be
done having regard to the following principles:

\begin{dotlist}
 \item You should take care to estimate accurately the likely time commitment
and only take payment when you are satisfied that:
\begin{dashlist}
\item it is a reasonable payment for the work being done; and

\item in the case of public access work, that it is suitable for you to
undertake.
\end{dashlist}
\item If the amount of work required is unclear, you should consider staged
payments rather than a fixed fee in advance.

\item You should never accept an upfront fee in advance of considering
whether it is appropriate for you to take the case and considering
whether you will be able to undertake the work within a reasonable
timescale.

\item If the \emph{client} can reasonably be expected to understand such an
arrangement, you may agree that when the work has been done, you will
pay the \emph{client} any difference between that fixed fee and (if
lower) the fee which has actually been earned based on the time spent,
provided that it is clear that you will not hold the difference between
the fixed fee and the fee which has been earned on trust for the
\emph{client}. That difference will not be \emph{client money} if you
can demonstrate that this was expressly agreed in writing, on clear
terms understood by the \emph{client}, and before payment of the fixed
fee. You should also consider carefully whether such an arrangement is
in the \emph{client's} interest, taking into account the nature of the
instructions, the \emph{client} and whether the \emph{client} fully
understands the implications. Any abuse of an agreement to pay a fixed
fee subject to reimbursement, the effect of which is that you receive
more money than is reasonable for the case at the outset, will be
considered to be holding \emph{client money} and a breach of rC73. For
this reason, you should take extreme care if contracting with a
\emph{client} in this way.

\item In any case, rC22 requires you to confirm in writing the acceptance of
any instructions and the terms or basis on which you are acting,
including the basis of charging.
    
\end{dotlist}

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC108}

Acting in the following ways may demonstrate compliance with Rules rC73,
rC74 and rC75:

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC109}

Checking that any third party payment service you may use is not
structured in such a way that the service provider is holding, as your
agent, money to which the \emph{client} is beneficially entitled. If
this is so you will be in breach of Rule rC73.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC110}

Considering whether your \emph{client} will be safe in using the third
party payment service as a means of transmitting or receiving funds. The
steps you should take in order to satisfy yourself will depend on what
would be expected in all the circumstances of a reasonably competent
legal adviser acting in their \emph{client's} best interests. However,
you are unlikely to demonstrate that you have acted competently and in
your \emph{client's} best interests if you have not:
\begin{numlist}\item ensured that the payment service is authorised or regulated as a
payment service by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and taken
reasonable steps to satisfy yourself that it is in good standing with
the FCA;
\item if the payment service is classified as a small payment institution,
ensured that it has arrangements to safeguard \emph{clients'} funds or
adequate insurance arrangements;
\item ensured that the payment service segregates \emph{client money} from
its own funds;
\item satisfied yourself that the terms of the service are such as to
ensure that any money paid in by or on behalf of the \emph{client} can
only be paid out with the \emph{client's} consent;
\item informed your \emph{client} that moneys held by the payment service
provider are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
\end{numlist}
\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC111}

Unless you are reasonably satisfied that it is safe for your client to

Where you are working in a \emph{BSB entity}, you will satisfy the
requirements of Rule rC76(1) so long as the \emph{BSB entity} has taken
out insurance, which covers your activities. A \emph{BSB entity} will
have to confirm each year that it has reviewed the adequacy of its
insurance cover on the basis of a risk analysis and that they have
complied with this rule.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC114}

Any notice issued under Rule rC76 will be posted on the \emph{Bar
Standards Board's} website and may also be publicised by such other
means as the \emph{Bar Standards Board} may judge appropriate. Notices
issued under Rule C76, which stipulate minimum terms of cover for
\emph{self-employed barristers} and \emph{BSB entities}, are currently
in force and available on the \emph{Bar Standards Board's} website.

The \emph{Bar Standards Board's} requirements in respect of professional
indemnity insurance, including the minimum terms, are concerned with
ensuring consumer protection, specifically that there is adequate cover
for liabilities which \emph{BSB regulated persons} may incur to their
\emph{clients} or other parties to whom they may owe duties when
performing their \emph{legal services}. This includes claims for
contribution which third parties, such as instructing \emph{solicitors},
may make on the basis that the \emph{BSB regulated person} has such a
liability to a mutual \emph{client}. However, Rule C76(1) of the
\emph{Handbook} \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{does not}} require \emph{BSB regulated persons} to carry
insurance for other types of liability, which do not relate to their
liabilities towards consumers, such as a contractual liability to
instructing \emph{solicitors} in respect of losses incurred by the
\emph{solicitor} that are not based on any liability the
\emph{solicitor} has in turn incurred to the \emph{client}. Nor are the
minimum terms concerned with the latter type of liability and whether
and on what terms to seek to insure against such exposure is a
commercial judgment for \emph{BSB regulated persons} to make. You should
however ensure that you are aware of and comply with any general legal
requirements for you to carry other types of insurance than professional
indemnity cover.

\emph{BSB regulated persons} considering excluding or limiting liability
should consider carefully the ramifications of the Unfair Contract Terms
Act 1977 and other legislation and case law. If a \emph{BSB regulated
person} is found by the court to have limited liability in a way which
is in breach of the Unfair Contract Terms Act, that might amount to
professional misconduct.

\emph{BSB regulated persons} should regularly review the amount of their
professional indemnity insurance cover, taking into account the type of
work which they undertake and the likely liability for negligence. They
should be aware that claims can arise many years after the work was
undertaken and that they would be prudent to maintain adequate insurance
cover for that time since cover operates on a ``claims made'' basis and
as such it is the policy and the limits in force at the time a claim is
made that are relevant, not the policy and limits in force when the work
was undertaken. They should also bear in mind the need to arrange
run-off cover if they cease practice.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC115}

Where you are working in an \emph{authorised (non-BSB) body}, the rules
of the \emph{approved regulator} of that body will determine what
insurance the \emph{authorised (non-BSB) body} \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} have.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC116}

Where you are working as an \emph{employed barrister (non-authorised
body)}, the rule \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{does not}} require you to have your own insurance if you
provide \emph{legal services} only to your \emph{employer}. If you
supply \emph{legal services} to other people (to the extent permitted by
the Scope of Practice and Authorisation, and Licensing Rules set out at
Section S(b) you should consider whether you need insurance yourself
having regard to the arrangements made by your \emph{employer} for
insuring against claims made in respect of your services. If your
\emph{employer} already has adequate insurance for this purpose, you
need not take out any insurance of your own. You should ensure that your
\emph{employer's} policy covers you, for example, for any pro-bono work
you may do.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC117}

Where you are a \emph{registered European lawyer}, the rule \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{does not}}

accordance with the rules of your \emph{home State}; and
\item the \emph{Bar Standards Board} is satisfied that such insurance or
guarantee is fully equivalent in terms of conditions and extent of cover
to the cover required pursuant to Rule rC76. However, where the
\emph{Bar Standards Board} is satisfied that the equivalence is only
partial, the \emph{Bar Standards Board} may require you to arrange
additional insurance or an additional guarantee to cover the elements
which are not already covered by the insurance or guarantee contracted

The purpose of Rules rC79 to rC85 is to ensure that \emph{clients} and
members of the public are not confused by any such association. In
particular, the public should be clear who is responsible for doing
work, and about the extent to which that person is regulated in doing
it: see Rules rC79-85.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC121}

This \emph{Handbook} applies in full whether or not you are practising
in an association. You are particularly reminded of the need to ensure
that, notwithstanding any such association, you continue to comply with
Rules C8, C9, C10, C12, C15, C19, C20, C28, C73, C75, C79, C82 and C86
(and, where relevant C80, C81, C83, C74 and C110).

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC122}

References to ``organisation'' in Rules rC81 and C82 include \emph{BSB
entities} and \emph{authorised (non-BSB) bodies}, as well as
non-authorised bodies. So, if you have an interest, as owner, or
manager, in any such body, your relationship with any such organisation
is caught by these rules.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC123}

These rules do not permit you to accept \emph{instructions} from a third
party in any case where that would give rise to a potential conflict of
interest contrary to \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD2}} or any relevant part of Rule rC21.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC124}

You should only refer a \emph{client} to an organisation in which you
have a material commercial interest if it is in the \emph{client's} best
interest to be referred to that organisation. This is one aspect of what
is required of you by \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD2}}. Your obligations of honesty and integrity, in
 \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD3}}, require you to be open with \emph{clients} about any interest you
have in, or arrangement you have with, any organisation to which you
properly refer the \emph{client}, or from which the \emph{client} is
referred to you. It is inherently unlikely that a general referral
arrangement obliging you (whether or not you have an interest in such
organisation) to refer to that organisation, without the option to refer
elsewhere if the \emph{client's} circumstances make that more
appropriate, could be justified as being in the best interests of each
individual \emph{client} (\textcolor{mygold}{\textbf{CD2}}) and it may well also be contrary to your
obligations of honesty and integrity ( \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD3}}) and compromise your
independence ( \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD4}}).

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC125}

The \emph{Bar Standards Board} may require you to provide copies of any
protocols that you may have in order to ensure compliance with these
rules.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC126}

Your obligations under  \textbf{\textcolor{mygold}{CD5}} require you not to act in \emph{an
association} with a person where, merely by being associated with such
person, you may reasonably be considered as bringing the profession into
disrepute or otherwise diminishing the trust that the public places in
you and your profession.

\begin{numlist}
\item the arrangements in place in your \emph{chambers} or \emph{BSB
entity} for the management of \emph{chambers} or the \emph{BSB entity};
and

\item \emph{barristers} returning from \emph{parental leave};
\end{numlist}

\guidancesection{Guidance
to Rules C110-C112 }


\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC140}

Rule rC110 places a personal obligation on all \emph{self-employed
barristers}, however they practise, and on the \emph{managers} of
\emph{BSB entities}, as well as on the entity itself, to take reasonable
steps to ensure that they have appropriate policies which are enforced.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC141}

In relation to Rule rC110, if you are a Head of \emph{chambers} or a
\emph{HOLP} it is likely to be reasonable for you to ensure that you
have the policies required by Rule rC110, that an \emph{Equality and
Diversity Officer} is appointed to monitor compliance, and that any
breaches are appropriately punished. If you are a member of a
\emph{chambers} you are expected to use the means available to you under
your constitution to take reasonable steps to ensure there are policies
and that they are enforced. If you are a \emph{manager} of a \emph{BSB
entity}, you are expected to take reasonable steps to ensure that there
are policies and that they are enforced.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC142}

For the purpose of Rule rC110 training means any course of study
covering all the following areas:
\begin{alphlist}
\item Fair and effective selection \& avoiding unconscious bias

\item Attraction and advertising

\item Application processes

\item Shortlisting skills

\item Interviewing skills

\item Assessment and making a selection decision

\item Monitoring and evaluation
\end{alphlist}
\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC143}

Training should ideally be undertaken via classroom sessions. However,
it is also permissible for training to be undertaken in the following
ways: online sessions, private study of relevant materials such as the
Bar Council's Fair Recruitment Guide and completion of CPD covering fair
recruitment and selection processes.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC144}

The purpose of Rule rC110(3)(d) is to ensure that applicants with relevant
characteristics are not refused employment because of such
characteristics. In order to ensure compliance with this rule,
therefore, it is anticipated that the \emph{Equality and Diversity
Officer} will compile and retain data about the relevant characteristics
of all applicants for the purposes of reviewing the data in order to see
whether there are any apparent disparities in recruitment.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC145}

For the purpose of Rule rC110 ``regular review'', means as often as is
necessary in order to ensure effective monitoring and review takes
place. In respect of data on pupils it is likely to be considered
reasonable that ``regularly'' should mean annually. In respect of
managers of a \emph{BSB entity} or tenants, it is likely to be
considered reasonable that ``regularly'' should mean every three years
unless the numbers change to such a degree as to make more frequent
monitoring appropriate.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC146}

For the purposes of Rule rC110, ``remedial action'' means any action
aimed at removing or reducing the disadvantage experienced by particular
relevant groups. Remedial action cannot, however, include positive
discrimination in favour of members of relevant groups.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC147}

Rule rC110(3)(f)(iii) places an obligation on \emph{practices} to take
reasonable steps to ensure the work opportunities are shared fairly
among its \emph{workforce}. In the case of \emph{chambers}, this
obligation includes work which has not been allocated by the solicitor
to a named \emph{barrister}. It includes fairness in presenting to
solicitors names for consideration and fairness in opportunities to
attract future named work (for example, fairness in arrangements for
marketing). These obligations apply even if individual members of
\emph{chambers} incorporate their practices, or use a ``ProcureCo'' to
obtain or distribute work, as long as their relationship between each
other remains one of independent service providers competing for the
same work while sharing clerking arrangements and costs.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC148}

a) Rule rC110(3)(k) applies to all members of \emph{chambers},
irrespective of whether their partner or spouse takes \emph{parental
leave}.

b) A flexible policy might include for example: keeping in touch (KIT)
days; returns to practice in between periods of \emph{parental leave};
or allowing a carer to practise part time.

c) Any periods of leave/return should be arranged between
\emph{chambers} and members taking \emph{parental leave} in a way that
is mutually convenient.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC149}

Rule rC110(3)(k)(vi) sets out the minimum requirements which \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{must}} be
included in a \emph{parental leave} policy if any element of rent is
paid on a flat rate. If rent is paid on any other basis, then the policy
should be drafted so as not to put any \emph{self-employed barrister} in
a worse position than they would have been in if any element of the rent
were paid on a flat rate.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC150}

For the purposes of Rule rC110 above investigation means, considering
the reasons for disparities in data such as:
\begin{numlist}\item Under or overrepresentation of particular groups e(g). men, women,
different ethnic groups or disabled people
\item Absence of particular groups e(g). men, women, different ethnic groups
or disabled people

3 Success rates of particular groups
\item In the case of \emph{chambers}, over or under allocation of
unassigned work to particular groups
\end{numlist}
\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC151}

These rules are supplemented by the BSB's Supporting Information on the
BSB Handbook Equality Rules (''the Supporting Information'') which is
available on the BSB's website. These describe the legal and regulatory
requirements relating to equality and diversity and provide guidance on
how they should be applied in \emph{chambers} and in \emph{BSB
entities}. If you are a \emph{self-employed barrister}, a \emph{BSB
entity}, or a \emph{manager} of a \emph{BSB entity}, you should seek to
comply with the Supporting Information as well as with the rules as set
out above.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC152}

The Supporting Information is also relevant to all \emph{pupil
supervisors} and \emph{AETOs}. \emph{AETOs} will be expected to show how
they comply with the Supporting Information as a condition of
authorisation.

\subsubsection{\color{darkgrey}gC153}

Although the Supporting Information \textcolor{myred}{\textbf{does not}} apply directly to \emph{BSB
authorised persons} working as \emph{employed barristers (non-authorised
bodies)} or \emph{employed barristers (authorised non-BSB body)}, they
provide helpful guidance which you are encouraged to take into account
in your practice.
